# Image-Projection

This project is for the [Robotics:Perception](https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-perception/home/week/2) Course by University of Pennsylvania.

The purpose of the project is to use the concepts of projective geometry and
homographies to project an image onto a scene in a natural way that
respects perspective.
